All the parts should be printed with brims enabled. I printed them with Gold (Body parts + MainBox and ServoArmsAttach) and Shiny Silver (Head and Arms) PLA.

These parts should be printed with 100% inside filling:
Body parts, MainBox, ServoArmsAttach

These parts should be printed with maximum supports enabled:
MotorsSupports, Head, MainBox, Arms

The Head and the Arms have to be as lightweight as possible, but don't print them hollow or you will break them while removing the supports (5% inside filling works well).
